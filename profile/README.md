# The Xcompact3d framework

The Xcompact3d framework is a Fortran code for developing high-order solvers
for the Navier-Stokes equations in the incompressible and low Mach number (LMN)
limits.

## Repositories

The primary repository is Incompact3d, this is our new combined implementation
including the original Incompact3d, Quasincompact3d (LMN) and Winc3d (wind farm) solvers.
The original archived repostiories are also available.

A post-processing framework build in Python is included in Py4Incompact3d, this
uses the same numerical methods as Incompact3d for performing consistent analyses.
